# module0-class-survey

This is a template repository for a group assignment to produce a descriptive analysis of class survey data.

Repository contents:

-   `data` contains survey responses on each of two sections stripped of identifying information, and a metadata file with variable names and descriptions
-   `scripts` contains the R script used to prepare the raw responses and the codes producing the results shown in class
-   `results` contains a template called `report.qmd` with some instructions about what to include in write-ups

Assignment instructions:

1.  Coordinate with your group on questions to explore and assign tasks. Not all tasks need to involve analyzing the data. For example, writing up results will be a task that may pair well with coordinating group activity. Working in pairs is recommended.
2.  Carry out your analysis in R scripts and store these in the `scripts` folder; if each person works on their own script, the potential for merge conflicts should be minimized and branches won't be necessary. Your scripts can be pretty messy; think of them as scratch work.
3.  Pool findings and decide what to include in your write-up. Prepare the write-up by modifying `report.qmd` .
4.  When your write-up is complete, render the document and then push changes to the main branch of your group repository. This counts as your submission. You can continue to make changes until the due date. Changes made after the due date may be made but are not guaranteed to receive review.
